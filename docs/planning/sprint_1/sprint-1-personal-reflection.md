## 1. Key Learning

The most significant insight was understanding **the importance of micro-task breakdown in agile development**. Initially approaching "Story #1" as a single task created visibility challenges. Once we broke it into specific components (data models, UI, logic), progress became measurable and dependencies clearer. This granular approach improved both estimation accuracy and daily progress reporting.

## 2. Assumptions Analysis

### 2.1 Failed Assumptions

| Assumption Category | Specific Assumption | Impact | Correction Strategy |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Task Scope | "Calendar UI is straightforward" | Underestimated by 2 days | Research complexity before estimation |
| Dependencies | "Backend and frontend can proceed independently" | Integration delays | Schedule integration checkpoints |
| Communication | "Daily standups suffice for coordination" | Missed technical decisions | Implement shared decision log |
| Capacity | "Can context-switch between stories efficiently" | Reduced focus | Limit work-in-progress to 2 stories |

### 2.2 Most Impactful Breakdown

**Dependency management** assumptions caused the most disruption. Assuming backend and frontend work were independent led to last-minute integration challenges that could have been avoided with earlier collaboration.

## 3. Behavioural Adjustments

For Sprint 2, I commit to **daily micro-task planning and tracking**. Instead of working from high-level story descriptions, I will:

1. Break each assigned story into 5-10 specific technical tasks
2. Timebox each micro-task (max 4 hours)
3. Update progress at the micro-task level in daily standups
4. Flag blockers as soon as a micro-task exceeds its timebox

## 4. Professional Development

### 4.1 Skill to Strengthen

**Frontend-Backend Integration Planning** - Developing ability to identify and plan for integration points between system components early in the development cycle.

### 4.2 Development Plan

1. **Learning:** Study integration patterns and API contract design (3 hours/week)
2. **Practice:** Create integration checklists for each story in Sprint 2
3. **Collaboration:** Initiate integration planning sessions with teammates
4. **Documentation:** Maintain integration decision log for team reference

## 5. Actionable Goals

### 5.1 Sprint 2 Objectives

- Reduce integration issues by 50% through early planning
- Improve task estimation accuracy to ±0.5 days
- Increase code review participation to 100% of completed work
- Document at least one integration pattern per completed story

### 5.2 Long-term Growth

- Develop expertise in full-stack integration strategies
- Improve ability to identify hidden dependencies in requirements
- Build proficiency in collaborative development tools (Git, project boards)
- Enhance communication skills for technical coordination
