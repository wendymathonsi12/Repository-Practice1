## 1. Retrospective Overview

### 1.1 Purpose & Scope

Evaluate team processes, collaboration effectiveness, and identify improvements for Sprint 2 based on actual Sprint 1 experience.

### 1.2 Methodology

Start-Stop-Continue framework with evidence from daily standups and sprint outcomes.

## 2. Process Analysis

### 2.1 Start - New Practices

- Implement structured daily standup template (yesterday/today/blockers)
- Create shared documentation for technical decisions
- Schedule mid-sprint check-ins for complex stories
- Establish clear handoff procedures between frontend/backend work

### 2.2 Stop - Hindering Practices

- Vague task descriptions ("work on Story #1")
- Assuming availability without confirmation
- Mixing development and testing phases
- Inconsistent update frequency in task tracking

### 2.3 Continue - Effective Practices

- Clear role division (backend/frontend specialization)
- Regular progress updates in daily standups
- Early integration of components
- Transparent communication about capacity and progress
- Pair programming on complex logic (authorization implementation)
