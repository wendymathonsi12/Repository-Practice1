## 1. Executive Summary

Sprint 1 successfully delivered core booking functionality with two major stories completed (US-1 fully, US-4 partially). The team established effective collaboration patterns and delivered working software increment. One story (US-6) was started but requires completion in Sprint 2.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

- ✅ **US-1 (Basic Room Booking):** Complete end-to-end implementation
  - Data models and database schema
  - Calendar view UI with availability display
  - Booking creation and confirmation workflow
  - Availability checking logic

- ✅ **US-4 (Booking Cancellation):** Core functionality implemented
  - Authorization logic (owner-based deletion)
  - Backend deletion logic
  - UI deletion buttons
  - Partial confirmation modal implementation

- 🔄 **Team Process Established:**
  - Daily standup routine implemented
  - Clear role division (backend/frontend)
  - Regular progress tracking
  - Collaborative problem-solving

## 3. Challenges Faced

- **Task Breakdown:** Initial tasks were too broad ("work on Story #1")
- **Integration Timing:** Frontend/backend integration delayed due to parallel work streams
- **Progress Visibility:** Difficulty tracking partial completion of complex stories
- **Scope Creep:** Additional considerations emerged during implementation (error handling, loading states)

## 4. Process Improvements Identified

1. **Task Granularity:** Break stories into smaller, specific tasks (max 1-2 days each)
2. **Integration Planning:** Schedule integration checkpoints during story implementation
3. **Progress Tracking:** Implement visual indicators for story completion percentage
4. **Documentation:** Create shared technical decision log
5. **Testing Integration:** Incorporate testing earlier in development cycle
