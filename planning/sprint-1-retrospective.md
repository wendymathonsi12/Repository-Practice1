## 1. Retrospective Overview

### 1.1 Purpose & Scope

Identify process improvements for Sprint 2 based on Sprint 1 experiences, focusing on planning, execution, and collaboration.

### 1.2 Methodology

Start-Stop-Continue framework with actionable outcomes.

## 2. Process Analysis

### 2.1 Start - New Practices

- Conduct requirement clarification sessions before story estimation
- Define clear "Definition of Done" for each story
- Implement dependency mapping during sprint planning
- Schedule 10-minute daily standups at 9:30 AM

### 2.2 Stop - Hindering Practices

- Using vague terminology in user stories (e.g., "pattern" in Story #2)
- Assuming team members understand dependencies without explicit discussion
- Working in silos without regular sync-ups
- Overcommitting to complex stories without risk assessment

### 2.3 Continue - Effective Practices

- Regular code review and pair programming sessions
- Using visual task boards (Kanban) for progress tracking
- Early stakeholder demos for feedback collection
- Transparent communication of blockers during daily standups
