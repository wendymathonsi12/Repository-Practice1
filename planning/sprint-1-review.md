## Completed Stories

| Story #                       | Outcome | Acceptance Criteria Met (Yes/No) |
|-------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| US-1 (Basic room booking)     | Core booking functionality implemented with calendar view and basic validation | Partially (2/3 acceptance criteria met) |
| US-4 (Booking cancellation)   | Cancel functionality with confirmation dialog implemented | Yes |

## Incomplete Stories  

| Story # | Reason | Decision (Carry / Split / Drop) |
|---------|--------|----------------------------------|
| US-6 (Admin dashboard viewing) | Ran out of time; more complex than estimated | Carry to Sprint 2 |
| US-2 (Recurring meetings setup) | Requirements unclear; "pattern" wording was vague | Split (Carry with clarified requirements) |

## Stakeholder Feedback

- Positive feedback: Basic booking flow works smoothly; cancellation feature is user-friendly
- Concerns or questions: Dependencies between stories were not clearly communicated during planning
- Requests or adjustments: Clarify wording in Story #2 - replace "set a pattern" with more specific terminology like "schedule recurring meetings"
